# Ingress
Ingress provides HTTP/HTTPS routing to services from outside the cluster:

- `Ingress Resources`: Kubernetes objects that define rules for external access to services.
- `Ingress Controllers`: Components that implement Ingress rules (e.g., NGINX, HAProxy, Traefik).

Key Features:
- Path-based routing
- Host-based routing
- TLS/SSL termination
- Name-based virtual hosting
- Load balancing
