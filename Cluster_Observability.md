# Advanced Networking Scenarios

## Multi-cluster Communication
For communication between multiple Kubernetes clusters, options include:
- Service meshes like Istio or Linkerd
- Multi-cluster service discovery tools
- Cluster federation

## Cloud Provider Integration
Most cloud providers offer specialized K8s networking features:
- AWS: AWS VPC-CNI, AWS Load Balancer Controller
- GCP: GKE VPC-native networking
- Azure: Azure CNI

## Service Mesh
Service meshes add an additional layer of networking capabilities:
- **Istio**: Advanced traffic management, security, and observability
- **Linkerd**: Lightweight service mesh focused on simplicity
- **Cilium Service Mesh**: eBPF-based service mesh

# Debugging Kubernetes Networking

Common tools and techniques:
- `kubectl exec` to run networking tools within Pods
- CoreDNS query logs
- CNI plugin logs
- `tcpdump` for packet analysis
- Service mesh observability tools
